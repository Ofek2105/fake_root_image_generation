Considerations for the future:
- Sometimes the hairs behaviour act more like a random walk then a BÃ©zier curve. Using random walk for the hairs as well might perform even better.
- Fixing up github repo and uploading the link to the peper


two primaries objectives:

1.	Develop and evaluate a root hair counting algorithm using the synthetic dataset, assessing its performance through standard metrics.
2.	Validate the efficacy of the synthetic dataset by comparing the algorithm's performance on synthetic images with its expected performance on real images.
    
contributions:

1.	An algorithm for counting root hairs that has been tested using the synthetic dataset, demonstrating the potential of synthetic data for algorithm development.
2.	Insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with synthetic data generation in the context of plant phenotyping, providing a foundation for future research in this area.


The width w_i  can vary along the root line to simulate natural variations in root thickness. This variation is achieved by introducing random noise or using a predefined function that modulates w_i based on the position along the root
